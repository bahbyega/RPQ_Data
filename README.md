===========================================================================

This directory contains the graphs, queries, source vertices and results of the multiple-source reachability benchmark

More information about the benchmark is provided here:

Folders:
    For each graph we provide the following benchmark information:
```
│
├──queries - regular gueries in the form of regular expressions
├──results - pares of <src, dest> vertices where 'src' is a source vertice, 'dest' - a vertice reachable from source vertice
└──src_verts - list of source vertices for running a benchmark

```
